## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayantani-12/unified_trend_driven_personalization_and_forecasting_system.git
   cd unified_trend_driven_personalization_and_forecasting_system
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium statsmodels matplotlib
   ```
4. Set up ChromeDriver:
   Download the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version.
   Move the downloaded chromedriver to a directory that's in your system's PATH, or specify the path in your script as follows:
   ```bash
   from selenium import webdriver
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
   ```
5. Making a CSV File
   Here is a simple script to create a CSV file:
   ```bash
   import csv

    data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['Alice', 30, 'New York'],
    ['Bob', 25, 'San Francisco'],
    ['Charlie', 35, 'Los Angeles']
    ]

    with open('user_name.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
      writer = csv.writer(file)
      writer.writerows(data)

   ```
   Run the above script to generate a user_name.csv file with your sample data.

## Usage
- Real-Time Data Collection: The files instagram_scraping and twitter_scraping are used to scrap data from various social media platforms
